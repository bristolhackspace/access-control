## Bristol Hackspace Access Control System

A web app for managing our:

- Member list
- Machine list
- Access Cards for the doors and machines
- Inductions and Inductors
- Questions and Answers for online inductions
- Logging

Built using Laravel.

## Access Control System

Access Control hardware is fitted to machines in the Hackspace, with RFID readers that when you put your Access Card against them can then use this system to check that your Membership is active, if an induction is required for that machine, and if you have completed your induction and are not suspended from the machine.

If you tick all the boxes, the machine will be unlocked for use.
